# Weather Web App

This web app serves to show the climate in a certain city/village of the user decision. It also shows 5 cities/villages in Portugal that are outside a 25km radius of the user decision and have nearly identical climates (humidity, temperature, felt temperature and a little climate description).

The aim of this web app was to try out the OpenWeatherMap and Google Maps API.
